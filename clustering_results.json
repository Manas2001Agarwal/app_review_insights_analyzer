Even after reopening the app the same message is displayed and I cant make any UPI payments. Please resolve this issue by providing a new version for this app."

However, the amount has already been deducted from my account. I tried waiting, but nothing has been updated. This is very disappointing and inconvenient. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible and improve the recharge service worst app dont use this app my sincere request"

Also allows to track your assets and liabilities, goals, helps to invest in mutual funds, shares, FDs, Insurance through multiple ways. It is improving day by day to add more features to have one window solutions to track your portfolio in real sense. I would suggest improvement in recurring or fixed entries for other, private or cash investments."

Perhaps a delay in the api call is happening tell the tech team to solve it. 2. When a see an option of buying or selling below a stock chart , when I change the option from delivery to intraday it should also show stoploss option there itself,I need to go back to the positions options and add SL which is quite inconvenient."

Option chain windows takes lot of space in web mode. Solution could be auto hide or manual hide feature in web mode 3. Advanced option chain option should be provided such as dhan, upstox. For other greeks 4. Paper trading feature or bactesting feature missing. 5. App crash so frequent."

Its just shiny app with fancy marketing I guess. The SIP features are so confusing and complicated. This product is made by too tech savvy idiots who dont care about customer satisfaction and usability Update After update this app is now even worse, I hit the buy button on any ticker and the app crashes"
