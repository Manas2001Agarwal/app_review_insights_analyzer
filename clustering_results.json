Perhaps a delay in the api call is happening tell the tech team to solve it. 2. When a see an option of buying or selling below a stock chart , when I change the option from delivery to intraday it should also show stoploss option there itself,I need to go back to the positions options and add SL which is quite inconvenient."

However, the amount has already been deducted from my account. I tried waiting, but nothing has been updated. This is very disappointing and inconvenient. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible and improve the recharge service worst app dont use this app my sincere request"

I dont know what you are building but you should test it before deployment to live audience. my phone is never rooted, I tried with another phone as well it show same message. lets assume my phone is compromised but 3 people in my house use indMoney and everyone sees this device is rooted. No, something is not working at your end, please check."
